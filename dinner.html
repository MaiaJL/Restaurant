        The future is unknown! We are taking a few classic <br>
        dinner options but adding a twist. Becuase you never know <br>
        maybe it'll be popular some day!

    <p class="Moveside">
        When you look at the picture of our steaks you think <br>
        what is different? Well this steak is brought to you by <br>
        a drone! It will fly to your table and set it down nicely <br>
        in front of you. Only $10.77!
    </p>
    <img id="Center" src="Images 3/Spaghetti.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="Moveback">
        This spaghetti is unlike anything else <br>
        it may look normal but there is a surprise in the middle. <br>
        A cupcake! We don't have a picture becuase you'll have to <br>
        wait and see! Sounds weird but it makes for a fun game while <br>
        you eat. Only $8.95
    </p>
    <img id="Side" src="Images 3/Enchaladas.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="Moveside">
        These Enchaladas are to die for! And guess what? They are huge! <br>
        You get 2 two foot long enchaladas served with a side salad. <br>
        Only $6.99
    </p>
    <img id="Center" src="Images 3/Street tacos.webp" alt="">
    <p class="Moveback">
        Like Our steak, the street tacos are given to you by something <br>
        different than a person. With this one you get a robot! How cool <br>
        is that? Only $9.56
